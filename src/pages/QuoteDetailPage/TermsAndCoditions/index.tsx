Introduction
These terms and conditions (the "Terms and Conditions"), together  with the provisions within your confirmation of booking ("Booking  Confirmation") set out the terms on which you book travel arrangements  with YourGolfTravel.com ("we", "us", "our").
YourGolfTravel.com is the trading name of Your Golf Travel Ltd, a  company registered in England and Wales under company number 05250279,  whose registered office is at Cloister Court, 22-26 Farringdon Lane,  London EC1R 3AJ.
The travel arrangements you see on this website or in our brochures  are provided by third parties, which are responsible for the provision  of the travel arrangements you have booked (the "Supplier  Principal(s)"). We do not own, control or operate those Supplier  Principals or the accommodation, flights, car hire, other transport,  golf facilities or other arrangements which you book through us. All the  travel arrangements which feature on this website or in our brochures  are sold by us as an agent for the actual Supplier Principals of the  travel arrangements except where we indicate that the travel  arrangements are sold by us as a principal.
In these terms and conditions:
Section A  applies to hotel bookings (which may include pre-booked rounds of golf  at the same accommodation and which are available to all guests as part  of its overall general facilities), where we act as the agent of the  Supplier Principal and your contract for the provision of the hotel  arrangement will be with the Supplier Principal.
Section B  applies to the sale of Packages organised by us. We sell two types of  Packages: Single Contract Packages (where we act as the principal and  your contract is with us) and Multi Contract Packages (where we act as  an agent for each Supplier Principal and you have a separate contract  for each travel arrangement with each Supplier Principal). We explain  our Package sales in more detail in Section B.
Section C  applies to hotel only bookings, where we act as a principal and your  contract for the provision of the hotel arrangement will be with us. We  do not sell hotel and pre-booked rounds of golf at the same  accommodation as a principal â€“ as described in Section A above, we make  these types of bookings as an agent for the Supplier Principal.
Section D applies to bookings of tickets for the Ryder Cup, US Masters or other golf tournaments.
Section E contains terms which apply to all bookings.
Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before booking with  us. They set out your rights and our obligations to you.
